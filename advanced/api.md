### NexHLSAES128DRMManager.IAESCallbackListener Interface Reference

An interface for GetKeyExternal and IsSupportKey Callbacks.

This must be implemented by the application.


#### byte[] getKeyFromExternal (String strKeyUrl)

Callback function to retrieve an encryption key from an HLS playlist over HTTPS for descrambling.

This function is called each time a new playlist is received and an encryption key is available in the playlist.

**Parameters**

| Name  | Description  | 
|---|---|
| strKeyUrl | A pointer to the URL of the encryption key.|
 
**Returns**
 
A byte array where the encryption key information will be stored.
 
#### boolean isSupportKeyAttr (String strKeyAttr, String strURL)

Callback function that verifies whether or not a key attribute is supported by the DRM module.

This callback is called when NexPlayer meets `#EXT-X-KEY` tags while NexPlayer is parsing playlists. If the callback returns a non-zero value, NexPlayer will not call DRM functions even if that function is registered.

**Parameters**

| Name  | Description  | 
|---|---|
| strURL | The URL of the playlist.|
| strKeyAttr | Key information of the segment that has been received.|
 
**Returns**

If the DRM supports that key attribute, then it should return TRUE. Then, NexPlayer will call DRM callbacks depending on the encryption method. If the DRM does not support the key, then it should return FALSE.
In this case, NexPlayer will not call the "getKeyFromExternal" callbacks and it will decrypt using its internal decryption function.
  
### NexPlayer.IDynamicThumbnailListener Interface Reference

This interface must be implemented in order for the application to receive Dynamic Thumbnail events from NexPlayer.

NexPlayer will call the methods provided in this interface automatically during playback to notify the application when various Dynamic Thumbnail events have occurred.

In most cases, the handling of these events is optional; NexPlayer will continue play content back normally without the application doing anything special in response to the events received.

#### void onDynamicThumbnailData (NexPlayer mp, int width, int height, int cts, Object bitmap)

This method will be called by the NexPlayer engine when thumbnail data is created.

If the `enableDynamicThumbnail()` method is called before Smooth Streaming content is in the open state, then this method will be called and gets the thumbnail information associated with the content.

**Parameters**

| Name  | Description  | 
|---|---|
| mp | The NexPlayer object generating the event.|
| width | The width of the thumbnail image.|
| height | The height of the thumbnail image.|
| cts | The current timestamp of the thumbnail image.|
| bitmap | RGB buffer pointer(RGB565) of the thumbnail image.| 
 
> Implemented in NexEventReceiver.

#### void onDynamicThumbnailRecvEnd (NexPlayer mp)

This callback method informs the Dynamic Thumbnail listener when the end of thumbnail data is received.

**Parameters**
 
| Name  | Description  | 
|---|---|
| mp | The NexPlayer object generating the event.|
 
> Implemented in NexEventReceiver.

### NexPlayer.IListener Interface Reference

The application must implement this interface in order to receive events from NexPlayer.

> **CAUTION:** These callbacks may occur in any thread, not necessarily the main application thread. In some cases, it may not be safe to call UI-related functions from with in IListener callbacks. The safest way to update the UI is to use `android.os.Handler` to post an event back to the main application thread.

NexPlayer will call the methods provided in this interface automatically during playback to notify the application when various events have occurred.

In most cases, the handling of these events is optional; NexPlayer will continue playback normally without the application doing anything special. There are a few exceptions to this which are listed below.

There are two categories of notifications. First of all, for any asynchronous command issued to NexPlayer (via the appropriate method call), a callback will occur when that command has completed to notify the application of the success or failure of the operation.

The other category of notifications are notifications that occur during playback to notify the application of changes in the state of NexPlayer. For example, if NexPlayer begins buffering data during streaming playback, an event occurs to allow the application to display an appropriate message, if necessary.

For asynchronous commands, the application will generally want to take action in the following cases (some applications may need to handle these differently depending on their requirements; these are correct for most cases):

- When any command fails, display an error to the user.
- When an open command succeeds, issue a start command to begin actual playback.
- When a stop command succeeds, issue a close command to close the file.

This is because commands such as open and stop take some time to execute, and follow-up commands such as
start and close can not be called immediately, but must wait until the first command has completed.

> **Warning** However, do not call close in these event handlers as this may give rise to a deadlock. A safe way to call `close` is to use the Android UI main threadâ€™s message handler.

> See each individual `IListener` method for a recommendation on how to implement that method in your application.


#### void onAsyncCmdComplete (NexPlayer mp, int command, int result, int param1, int param2)

When an asynchronous method of NexPlayer has completed successfully or failed, this event occurs.

**Parameters**

| Name  | Description  | 
|---|---|
| mp | The NexPlayer object generating the event.|
| command | The command which completed. This may be any of the following **Values:**|
| result | Zero if the command was successful, otherwise an error code.|

#### void onHTTPRequest (NexPlayer mp, String strRequest)

This method allows NexPlayer to pass HTTP request messages to an application.

While NexPlayer normally handles HTTP requests and responses internally, in cases where additional information is required from the server (for example user cookies), this method can be used in conjunction with `onHTTPResponse` to allow an application to handle that information directly.

> **Note** This should be called before a request is sent to an HTTP server. To modify an HTTP request, see `onModifyHttpRequest`. To handle the response received, call `onHTTPResponse`.
 
**Parameters**

> Implemented in NexEventReceiver.


#### void onHTTPResponse (NexPlayer mp, String strResponse)

This method allows responses from an HTTP server to be received and handled in a more customized way.

While NexPlayer normally handles HTTP requests and responses internally, in cases where additional information is required from the server (for example user cookies), this method can be used in conjunction with onHTTPRequest to handle that information directly.

> **Note** This should be called after a response has been received from the server. To change the requests being made, onModifyHttpRequest should be called.
 
**Parameters**

| Name  | Description  | 
|---|---|
| mp | The NexPlayer object to which this event applies.|  
| strResponse | The response from the HTTP server, as a string.|   
 
**See Also**

#### void onPauseSupervisionTimeOut (NexPlayer mp)

Reports Pause Supervision Timeout.

**Parameters**

| Name  | Description  | 
|---|---|
| mp | The NexPlayer object to which this event applies.|  

> Implemented in NexEventReceiver.

#### void onPictureTimingInfo (NexPlayer mp, NexPictureTimingInfo[] arrPictureTimingInfo)

This method provides SEI picture timing information about video frames of H.264 content when available.

This method is called when `ENABLE_H264_SEI` is enabled and the H.264 content contains supplemental en-
hancement information (SEI). While SEI may include a variety of attributes, this method specifically receives SEI picture timing information when available.

NexPlayer delivers the timing information through this method by passing an instance of NexPictureTimingInfo whenever SEI picture timing information is received.

**Parameters**

| Name  | Description  | 
|---|---|
| mp | The NexPlayer object to which this event applies.|  
|arrPictureTimingInfo|The NexPictureTimingInfo object that includes the SEI picture timing information for the content.|
 
> Implemented in NexEventReceiver.

#### void onProgramTime (NexPlayer mp,String strTag,long offset)

This retrieves the program time and date information from HLS content when the #EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME
tag is present.

This event happens approximately once every second when a .ts file is decoding (approximately every 30 frames). The `str` Tagvalue will remain the same until a new #EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tag is received in a subsequent segment, whereas the value of the timeoffsetparameter will continuously rise in subsequent frames until a new #EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tag is received.

The values fromstrTagandoffsetparameters can be added to determine the current frameâ€™s timestamp. The
time can then be used to help sync content and text streams or to determine when content should play.

> **Note** If the program time is required at a more specific moment in time, the same information can be retrieved by calling the method, getProgramTime.
 
**Parameters**

| Name  | Description  | 
|---|---|
| mp | The NexPlayer object generating the event.|
|strTag | The most recent #EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tag in the HLS content, as a string.|
|offset|The time offset of the currently decoding frameâ€™s timestamp with respect to the #EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tag time, in milliseconds.|
 
**See Also**
 
getProgramTime


> Implemented in NexEventReceiver.

#### void onRTSPCommandTimeOut (NexPlayer mp)

#### void onSessionData (NexPlayer mp, NexSessionData[] data)

This method reports the arbitrary session data of the HLS master playlist.

**Parameters**

| Name  | Description  | 
|---|---|
| mp | The NexPlayer object to which this event applies.|  
| data | The array of NexSessionData object that includes the arbitrary session data of the HLS master playlist.|  
 
> Implemented in NexEventReceiver.

#### void onSignalStatusChanged (NexPlayer mp, int pre, int now)

NexPlayerâ€™s signal status has been changed.

**Parameters**

| Name  | Description  | 
|---|---|
| mp | The NexPlayer object generating the event.|  
| pre | The previous signal status.| 
| now | The current signal status.| 
 
> Implemented in NexEventReceiver.


#### void onStateChanged ( NexPlayer mp, int pre, int now )

NexPlayerâ€™s state has been changed.

This method is called when NexPlayerâ€™s state has been changed but it does not mean that the changing operation has completed. Therefore, the next operation can be carried out only after the event onAsyncCmdComplete is received, not when this event, onStateChanged, is called.

**Parameters**

| Name  | Description  | 
|---|---|
| mp | The NexPlayer object generating the event.|
| pre | The previous play status.| 
| mp | The current play status.|
 
> Implemented in NexEventReceiver.

#### void onStatusReport ( NexPlayer mp, int msg, int param1 )

This function is called when there is a change in the available content information.

This can happen, for example, if the track changes during HLS playback, resulting in changes to the bitrate, resolution, or even the codec in use.

The msg parameter contains information about the condition that has changed.

Since multiple calls to this function can be issued for the same event, unknown values for msg should generally be ignored. To handle general status changes that affect content information without processing duplicate
messages, the best approach is just to handle NEXPLAYER\_STATUS\_REPORT\_CONTENT\_INFO\_UPDATED.

To determine the new content information when this event occurs, call getContentInfo or getContentInfoInt.

**Parameters**

| Name  | Description  | 
|---|---|
| mp | The NexPlayer object to which this event applies.|
| param1 | Additional information. The meaning of this depends on the value of msg. If the description above doesnâ€™t refer to param1, then this parameter is undefined for that value of msg and should not be used.|
| msg | The type of notification. This is one of the following **Values:**| 

- `NEXPLAYER_STATUS_REPORT_NONE (0x00000000)` 
No status change (thisvalue is not normally passed to onStatusReport, and should generally be ignored).

- `NEXPLAYER_STATUS_REPORT_AUDIO_GET_CODEC_FAILED (0x00000001)` 
Failed to determine the audio codec. This notification can happen at the beginningof playback, or during playback if there is an audio codec change. This can happenbecause of a switch to a new codec that NexPlayer does not support, or due to anerror in the format of the content or corrupted data in the content.

- `NEXPLAYER_STATUS_REPORT_VIDEO_GET_CODEC_FAILED (0x00000002)` 
Failed to determine the video codec. This notification can happen at the beginningof playback, or during playback if there is a video codec change. This can happenbecause of a switch to a new codec that NexPlayer does not support, or due to anerror in the format of the content or corrupted data in the content.

- `NEXPLAYER_STATUS_REPORT_AUDIO_INIT_FAILED (0x00000003)` 
 The audiocodec failed to initialize. This can happen for several reasons. The container mayindicate the wrong audio codec, or the audio stream may be incorrect or corrupted,or the audio stream may use a codec version or features that NexPlayer doesnâ€™tsupport.

- `NEXPLAYER_STATUS_REPORT_VIDEO_INIT_FAILED (0x00000004)` 
 The videocodec failed to initialize. This can happen for several reasons. The container mayindicate the wrong video codec, or the video stream may be incorrect or corrupted,or the video stream may use a codec version or features that NexPlayer doesnâ€™tsupport.

- `NEXPLAYER_STATUS_REPORT_TRACK_CHANGED (0x00000005)`

The ID of the new track can be found in mCurrTrackID, and also in param1. When this event occurs, NexPlayer also generates a NEXPLAYER\_CONTENT\_INFO\_UPDATED event.

- `NEXPLAYER_STATUS_REPORT_STREAM_CHANGED (0x00000006)` 
 The streambeing played back has changed (between the states AudioOnly, VideoOnly and Audio+Video). The new stream type is in mMediaType, and also in param1.

- `NEXPLAYER_STATUS_REPORT_DSI_CHANGED (0x00000007)` 
 An attribute relating to the video or audio format (such as the resolution, bitrate, etc.)` 
 has changed. This is considered Decoder Specific Information (DSI).

- `NEXPLAYER_STATUS_REPORT_OBJECT_CHANGED (0x00000008)` 
 One of thecodec objects in use has changed (that is, the audio or video codec in use haschanged). See mAudioCodec and mVideoCodec to get the ID of the new codec.

- `NEXPLAYER_STATUS_REPORT_CONTENT_INFO_UPDATED (0x00000009)` 
 The content information has changed. When onStatusReport is called with any other non Failure value for msg, it will also be called with this as well. This is a good place to monitor insignificant changes to the content information.

- `NEXPLAYER_STATUS_REPORT_DOWNLOAD_PROGRESS (0x00000080)` 
 Reports the progress made storing content for offline play. This message will be calledwhen content is opened with NEXPLAYER\_SOURCE\_TYPE\_STORE\_STREAM type.For this notification, the parameter param1 returns the percentage of downloading completed (0-100).

- `NEXPLAYER_STATUS_REPORT_AVMODE_CHANGED (0x0000000A)` 
 Thestream being played back has changed and the new stream has a different mediatype. This event happens whenever the state changes between video-only, audio-only and audio-video. param1 contains the new media - Type: 1 for audio, 2 for video, 3 for both.

- `NEXPLAYER_STATUS_REPORT_HTTP_INVALID_RESPONSE (0x0000000B)` 
 An HTTP error response was received from the server.param1 contains the error code(this is a normal HTTP response code, such as 404, 500, etc.)

- `NEXPLAYER_STATUS_REPORT_DISCONTINUITY_EXIST (0x00000012)` 
 There is a discontinuity tag found in the HLS content playlist.

- `NEXPLAYER_STATUS_REPORT_EXTERNAL_DOWNLOAD_CANCELED(0x00000020)` 
 The player canceled External PD Mode and played content onNormal PD Mode. (e.g. The engine attempted to play regular content instead of piffcontent on External PD Mode).

- `NEXPLAYER_STATUS_REPORT_MINMAX_BANDWIDTH_CHANGED(0x00000021)` 
 Either the Minimum bandwidth or Maximum bandwidth has beenchanged.

- `NEXPLAYER_STATUS_REPORT_STREAM_RECV_PAUSE (0x00000060)` 
 Whenthe prefetch buffer exceeds the maximum value, the player pauses the buffer control.The user can adjust the maximum value of the prefetch buffer by using setProperty ofthe properties MAX\_BUFFER\_RATE or MAX\_BUFFER\_DURATION.

- `NEXPLAYER_STATUS_REPORT_STREAM_RECV_RESUME (0x00000061)` 
 Whenthe prefetch buffer is below the minimum value, the player resumes the buffer control. The user can adjust the mimimum value of the prefetch buffer by using setProperty ofthe properties MIN\_BUFFER\_RATE or MIN\_BUFFER\_DURATION.

- `NEXPLAYER_STATUS_REPORT_DOWNLOAD_PROGRESS (0x00000080)` 
 Reports the progress made storing content for offline play. This message will be calledwhen content is opened with NEXPLAYER\_SOURCE\_TYPE\_STORE\_STREAM type.For this notification, the parameter param1 returns the percentage of downloadingcomplete (0-100).

- `NEXPLAYER_STATUS_REPORT_MAX (0xFFFFFFFF)` 
 This value is reserved; do not use it.

#### void onTime ( NexPlayer mp, int millisec )

This method indicates that playback has progressed to the specified position.

This event occurs once per second. If the application is displaying the current play position, it should update it to reflect this new value.

Applications that wish to update the play time more often that once per second or with a greater accuracy may ignore this event and create their own timer, in which case they can use the current play time reported in NexContentInformation.

**Parameters**

| Name  | Description  | 
|---|---|
| mp | The NexPlayer object generating the event.|
| millisec | Current play position in milliseconds.|
 
> Implemented in NexEventReceiver.

### NexALFactory Class Reference

The primary interface to the `NexALFactory`.

`NexALFactory` handles codecs and renderer selection for the NexPlayer SDK. To use the NexPlayer SDK, the application must create an instance of the `NexALFactory` class (supplied as part of the NexPlayer SDK).

In addition, an application must also do the following:

1. Create an instance of NexPlayer  and an instance of `NexALFactory` and set the codec usage policy.

 	```java
		mNexPlayer = new NexPlayer();
		mNexALFactory = new NexALFactory();
	```
 
2. Call the `NexALFactory.init` method, passing the model name of the current device.

 	```java
		mNexALFactory.init(this, android.os.Build.MODEL, android.os.Build.MODEL, nLogLevel, colorDepth);
		mNexPlayer.setNexALFactory(mNexALFactory);
		mNexPlayer.init(this, 1);
	```
 
3. After playback by NexPlayer, `NexALFactory.release` should be called when instances of NexPlayer and
    `NexALFactory` are no longer needed.

 	```java
		mNexPlayer.release();
		mNexALFactory.release();
	```
 
**Classes**

- `interface ICodecDownListener`
- `enum NexALFactoryErrorCode`
   
    Possible error codes that can be returned by NexPlayerâ€™s *NexALFactory*.

**Protected Member Functions**

- `native void setExternalSurfaceMode (int mode)`
- `void finalize ()`
    
    Releases native resources.

**Static Protected Attributes**

- `static final int NEX\_EXTERNAL\_VIEW\_SURFACETEXTURE = 1`

- 2 : specific devices that are verified to support hardware codecs.

#### int downloadCodec (NexCodecInformation codecInfo)

This method downloads a codec.

> **Warning** This must be called after `NexALFactory.getDownloadableCodecs` has been called.
 
After a codec is downloaded by calling this method, the application should also call *`NexALFactory.rescanCodecs` to
inform NexPlayer of the newly available codecs.

**Parameters**
 
| Name      | Description                                                     |

This method is called by the NexPlayer Engine. This is just for native methods. Donâ€™t use this method for other purposes.

#### boolean init (Context context, String strModel, String strRenderMode, int logLevel, int colorDepth)

Initializes `NexALFactory`.

NexPlayer automatically detects the devices where HW codecs and H.264 Main/High profiles can be supported so there is no need to indicate any specific device model to the player.

> **Warning** Although it is possible to change the device model parameter, *strModel*, it is not recommended because changing the model name may result in the H/W decoder not working properly. Please do NOT change the device model name in the sample code. Similarly, although it is possible to change the render mode parameter, *strRenderMode*, NexPlayer is only guaranteed to work properly with *strRenderMode* set to *NEX\_DEVICE\_USE\_AUTO*. Please do NOT change the render mode in the sample code.

| srtModel      | Device model name. NexPlayer includes multiple renderer modules, and past versions of the player selected the module most suitable to the device based on this value. The renderer is now set by the parameter *strRenderMode*. Under normal use, you should pass the MODEL as available via the Android API in *android.os.Build.MODEL*. For example:  	*nexALFactory.init(this, android.os.Build.MODEL, 	NEX\_DEVICE\_USE\_AUTO, 0, 1);*     NexPlayer uses this to select the most appropriate renderer if no renderer is selected (*NULL* is passed) with the parameter *strRenderMode* below. For OS versions up to Gingerbread, this is always the Android Renderer (although from Froyo, other renderers are supported as well) if the SW codec is in use. For Honeycomb and Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS), this is always the OpenGL renderer when the SW codec is in use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| srtRenderMode | The Renderer to use, as a string. The recommended render mode to use is *NEX\_DEVICE\_USE\_AUTO*, which will choose the most appropriate render mode automatically. |

**See Also**

 
- NexPlayer.getRenderMode for more details.
 
#### void release ( )

This method releases resources used by the `NexALFactory` instance.

This should be called when the instance is no longer needed. After calling this method, the instance can no longer
be used.

#### native int rescanCodecs ( )

This method rescans the codec files in the application files directory(*/data/data/<package\_name>/files*) to update the codecs available in NexPlayer.

> **Warning** This must be called after `NexALFactory.init` has been called.

|-------------|-----------|
| strAppUCode | The provided unique App code. |
 
**Returns**

Zero if successful, or a non-zero error code.
  
 
### NexALFactory.NexALFactoryErrorCode Enum Reference

Possible error codes that can be returned by NexPlayerâ€™s *NexALFactory*.

This is a Java *enum* so each error constant is an object, but it can be converted to or from a numerical code using
the instance and class methods.

To get the error constant of a given code, call: `fromIntegerValue(int)`.

To get the error description given an error constant, call: `getDesc()`.

To get the error code given an error constant, call: `getIntegerCode()`.

Because this is a Java *enum*, it is very easy to include the name of the error constant in error messages instead of
just the number values. For example, the following code logs the errors that are received from `NexALFactory`:

```java
void onCodecDownloaderEventError(NexALFactoryErrorCode errorCode) {
{
	NexLog.d( "onError",
		"Received the error: "
			+ errorCode.getDesc()
			+ " ("
			+ errorCode.getIntegerCode()
			+ ")."
	);
}
```

**Public Attributes**

- `ERROR_SW_CODEC_DOWNLOAD_INTERNAL_ERROR` = (-1, "Internal error or invalid socket handle.")
- `ERROR_SW_CODEC_DOWNLOAD_RECV_TIME_OUT` = (-2, "Receive time out.")
- `ERROR_SW_CODEC_DOWNLOAD_DNS_FAIL` = (-9, "DNS lookup failure.")
- `ERROR_SW_CODEC_DOWNLOAD_CONNECTION_FAIL` = (-11, "Connection failure.")


#### static NexALFactoryErrorCode fromIntegerValue (int code)

This method gets the error code of a given *NexALFactoryError*, from a given integer value.

#### String getDesc ( )

This method gets the description of a given *NexALFactoryError*, given an error constant.

#### int getIntegerCode ( )

This method gets the integer code for a given *NexALFactoryError*.

#### void onPictureTimingInfo (NexPlayer mp, NexPictureTimingInfo[ ] arrPictureTimingInfo)**

This method provides SEI picture timing information about video frames of H.264 content when available.

This method is called when *ENABLE_H264_SEI* is enabled and the H.264 content contains supplemental enhancement information (SEI). While SEI may include a variety of attributes, this method specifically receives SEI
picture timing information when available.

NexPlayer delivers the timing information through this method by passing an instance of `NexPictureTimingInfo`
whenever SEI picture timing information is received.

**Parameters**


| Name                 | Description                                                                                         |

Implements `NexPlayer.IListener`.

#### void onProgramTime (NexPlayer mp, String strTag, long offset)

This retrieves the program time and date information from HLS content when the #EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tag is present.

This event happens approximately once every second when a .ts file is decoding (approximately every 30 frames). The *strTag* value will remain the same until a new #EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tag is received in a subsequent segment, whereas the value of the time *offset* parameter will continuously rise in subsequent frames until a new #EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tag is received.

The values from *strTag* and *offset* parameters can be added to determine the current frameâ€™s timestamp. The time can then be used to help sync content and text streams or to determine when content should play.

>**Note** If the program time is required at a more specific moment in time, the same information can be retrieved by calling the method, getProgramTime.

**Parameters**

| Name   | Description                                                                                                                           |

| now  | The current signal status.                           |

Implements `NexPlayer.IListener`.

#### void onStateChanged (NexPlayer mp, int pre, int now)

NexPlayerâ€™s state has been changed.

This method is called when NexPlayerâ€™s state has been changed but it does not mean that the changing operation
has completed. Therefore, the next operation can be carried out only after the event *onAsyncCmdComplete* is
received, not when this event,*onStateChanged*, is called.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description                                  |
|------|--------------------------|
| mp   | The NexPlayer object generating the event |

Implements `NexPlayer.IListener`.

#### void onStatusReport (NexPlayer mp, int msg, int param1)

This function is called when there is a change in the available content information.

This can happen, for example, if the track changes during HLS playback, resulting in changes to the bitrate, resolution, or even the codec in use.

Themsgparameter contains information about the condition that has changed.

Because multiple calls to this function can be issued for the same event, unknown values for *msg* should generally be ignored. To handle general status changes that affect content information without processing duplicate
messages, the best approach is just to handle NEXPLAYER_STATUS_REPORT_CONTENT_INFO_UPDATED.

To determine the new content information when this event occurs, call `getContentInfo` or `getContentInfoInt`.

|-----------|---------------------------|
| mp        | The NexPlayer object to which this event applies.                                                                                                  |
| numTracks | The number of subtitle tracks available for this media. Note that this may be 0 if there are no subtitles, or this function may not be called at all. |

Implements `NexPlayer.IListener`.

#### void onTextRenderRender (NexPlayer mp, int trackIndex, NexClosedCaption textInfo)

This function is called when new subtitle data is ready for display.

This is called whenever playback reaches a point in time where subtitles on any track need to be displayed or cleared.

The text to display is provided in a *NexClosedCaption* object as a byte array; it is the responsibility of the application to convert this to text with the appropriate encoding. Where possible, the encoding information will be provided in the NexC osedCaption.mEncodingType, but many subtitle file formats do not explicitly specify an encoding, so it may be necessary for the application to guess the encoding or allow the user to select it.

**Parameters**


| Name       | Description                                                          |
|------------|------------------------------|
| mp         | The NexPlayer object to which this event applies.                 |
| trackIndex | This is always zero and should always be ignored.                    |
| textInfo   | The text to be displayed (cast this to a *NexClosedCaption* object). |

Implements `NexPlayer.IListener`.

#### void onTime (NexPlayer mp,int millisec)

This method indicates that playback has progressed to the specified position.

This event occurs once per second. If the application is displaying the current play position, it should update it to
reflect this new value.

Applications that wish to update the play time more often that once per second or with a greater accuracy may
ignore this event and create their own timer, in which case they can use the current play time reported in `NexContentInformation`.

**Parameters**

| Name     | Description                                  |
|----------|--------------------------|

### NexNetAddrTable Class Reference

This class allows an application to retrieve host information by using the hostname and its corresponding custom IP address registered by the developer.


**Classes**

- `class NetAddrTableInfo`
	
	This class defines the information possible for an entry made with the method addEntry, including the hostname and its corresponding IP address when a customized IP address is desired.

#### boolean addEntry (String hostname, String address)

This method adds an entry to the table of customized IP addresses.

An entry includes a hostname and its corresponding custom IP address. Depending on the table type set with the parameter nNetAddrTableType when calling NexPlayer.setNetAddrTable, the IP address corresponding to a particular hostname will be used to retrieve host information.

This table can be used as a fallback option (NETADDR\_TABLE\_FALLBACKtype) to retrieve host information, or it can be used to override (NETADDR\_TABLE\_OVERRIDEtype) the information in the existing host database.

A maximum of 5 entries can be assigned to a table.

**Parameters**

| Name  | Description  | 
|---|---|
| hostname | The hostname as aString.|  
| address | The custom IP address corresponding to the hostname set by the developer as aString.|  
 
**Returns**

1 if successful, otherwise 0.
 
#### final int NETADDR\_TABLE\_FALLBACK = 1

This is a possible table type for the method setNetAddrTable.

When the parameter `nNetAddrTableType` in `NexPlayer.setNetAddrTable` is set to this table type, the method will try to retrieve the host information from the existing host database using the given hostname. If this fails, the method will check the table registered as the parametertableto retrieve the custom IP address corresponding to the given hostname.

In other words, this means that the table of net addresses can be used as a fallback option when the needed host information cannot be retrieved.
 
#### final int NETADDR\_TABLE\_OVERRIDE = 0

This is a possible table type for the methodsetNetAddrTable.

When the parameter nNetAddrTableType in NexPlayer.setNetAddrTableis set to this table type, the method will try to get the host information using the hostname and its corresponding custom IP address, set by the developer, from the table registered as the parameter table. If this fails, the player will try to get the host information from the existing host database.

In other words, this means that the information in the table registered will be used with priority, overriding the information from the existing host database.
 
 
### NexPictureTimingInfo Class Reference

This class allows NexPlayer to handle SEI picture timing information in H.264 content.

In summary, this class passes timing information about each video frame in H.264 content if the content provides SEI picture timing information. NexPlayer passes an instance of this class through the onPictureTimingInfo listener.

In most cases, this information will include `mFullTimestampFlag`, `mSeconds`, `mMinutes`, and `mHours`. But also note that `mSeconds`, `mMinutes`, and `mHours` are valid **only** if `mFullTimestampFlag` is `1`.

#### NexPlayer( )

Sole constructor for NexPlayer.

After constructing a NexPlayer object, you must call NexPlayer.init before you can call any other methods

#

#### boolean addEventReceiver (NexEventReceiver receiver)

This method adds aneventreceiver.

> **Note** If the developer wants to register several IListeners, they can register a receiver with this method. If the developer set a listener with NexPlayer.setListener and added event receivers, NexPlayer will use the return value of the listener. If the developer did not set a listener and added only receivers, NexPlayer will use the return value of the last registered event receiver. Events will be forwarded in sequence from receivers to listener.
 
**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---|
| receiver | The object to which methods will be called when events occur.|  

**See Also**
 
- NexEventReceiver
- NexPlayer.removeReleaseListener
 
#### native int addHTTPHeaderFields (String str)

This function adds additional header fields to be sent along with the HTTP headers when sending streaming requests (HLS and Smooth Streaming).

The string should contain a single valid HTTP header, and should include the header name, value, and delimiter.

For example:

```java
addHTTPHeaderFields("X-Example: test value.");
```

> **Note** To add multiple header fields, simply call this function multiple times
 
**Parameters**
 
| Name | Description | 
|---|---|
| str | The header (including delimeter) to add to future HTTP requests.|  

**Returns**
 
Zero if successful, non-zero if there was an error.
 
#### int addNexClient (NexClient client)

This method adds a client module to NexPlayer.

> **Warning** Do not call this method when playing local content. It should only be used for streaming content.  Note that client modules are optional features of the NexPlayer SDK. For more information on how to integrate and use a client module available in the SDK (as well as sample code), please see the relevant NexXXXClient class.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---|
| client | The instance of the client module as aNexClientobject.|   
 
**Returns**

The client ID as an integer if successful, or -1 in the event of failure. Note that if no client module is available in the current version of the SDK, -1 will be returned.
 
**See Also**

- removeNexClient
- getClientStatus
 
#### void addReleaseListener (IReleaseListener listener)

Adds a callback that will be invoked when a NexPlayer instance is released.

This is a callback that provides certain minimal functionality. See the NexPlayer.IReleaseListener documentation for more information on implementation.

In an Android application, there are two common ways to implement this. The most typical approach is to have the Activity subclass implement the IReleaseListener interface.

The other approach is to define an anonymous class inline, as follows:

```java
mNexPlayer.addReleaseListener(new NexPlayer.IReleaseListener() {
	@Override
	public void onPlayerRelease(NexPlayer mp) {
	// ...event implementaton goes here...
	}
});
```

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---|
| listener |The object on which methods will be called when the instance of NexPlayer is released.| 


> This must implement the IReleaseListener interface.
 
**See Also**

- NexPlayer.IReleaseListener
- NexPlayer.removeReleaseListener
 
#### native int addRTSPHeaderFields (int methods, String str)

This function adds an RTSP header to be included with all future RTSP requests.

RTSP headers have the same format as HTTP headers, but the set of field names is different.

There are several request types that are part of the RTSP protocol, and when a header is added, you must specify with which request types it will be included. This is done by performing a bitwise OR on one or more of the following values, and specifying the result in the methods parameter:

- `RTSP_METHOD_DESCRIBE`
- `RTSP_METHOD_SETUP`
- `RTSP_METHOD_OPTIONS`
- `RTSP_METHOD_PLAY`
- `RTSP_METHOD_PAUSE`
- `RTSP_METHOD_GETPARAMETER`
- `RTSP_METHOD_TEARDOWN`
- `RTSP_METHOD_ALL`

For example, to set a different user agent for the SETUP and PLAY requests:

```java
addRTSPHeaderFields(RTSP_METHOD_SETUP | RTSP_METHOD_PLAY, "User-Agent: NexStreaming Android Player");
```

**Parameters**
 
 
| Name | Description | 
|---|---|
| methods |The set of request methods to which this will apply (RTSP\_METHOD\_âˆ— constants OR-ed together).| 
| str |The actual header to add (including header name and value).| 

**Returns**
 
Zero if successful, non-zero if there was an error.

|uiEffectStrength| This sets the strength of the audio mode selected. It is an integer between 0 and 6.|
|uiBassStrength| This sets the bass strength of the audio mode selected. It is an integer between 0 and 6.|
| uiAudioMode |The NexSound mode to set. This is an integer and will be one of:|

- `NEX_AS_EARCOMFORT = 0x00000001` : EarComfort mode moves the sound image to a position outside of the listenerâ€™s head, simulating the more comfortable feeling of listening to speakers but through earphones.
	- Default Values :
		- uiEffectStrength = 2
		- uiBassStrength = 3
- `NEX_AS_REVERB = 0x00000002` : Reverb mode adds reverb to audio. 
	- Default Values :
		- uiEffectStrength = 3
		- uiBassStrength = 3
- `NEX_AS_STEREO_CHORUS = 0x00000003` : Stereo Chorus mode. 
	- Default Values :
		- uiEffectStrength = 5 
		- uiBassStrength = 3
- `NEX_AS_MUSIC_ENHANCER = 0x00000004` : Music Enhancer mode. 
	- Default Values :
		- uiEffectStrength = 6 
		- uiBassStrength = 5
- `NEX_AS_CINEMA_SOUND = 0x00000006` : Virtual surround sound effect on ordinary earphones. This mode can only be turned ON and OFF and parameters `uiEffectStrength` and `uiBassStrength` do not apply.
 
**Returns**

Zero if successful, or a non-zero error code, including:
 
- `NOT_SUPPORT (0x8000000FL)` : The requested NexSound audio mode is not supported in this version.

#### native int captureVideo (int iCount, int iInterval)

This function begins capturing video frames.

This may be used to capture a single frame immediately, or to capture a series of frames at regular intervals. In either case, the captured frames are actually sent to the onVideoRenderCapture handler, so your application must implement it to receive the frames.

When this function is called, the current frame will immediately be sent toonVideoRenderCapture, and then
any scheduled frames will be sent after the specified interval has elapsed.

> **Warning** captureVideo is NOT supported.
 
**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---|
| iCount |The number of frames to capture; this should be at least 1 or the method has no effect.| 
| iInterval | If `iCount` is greater than 1, this is the number of milliseconds to wait between captures. For example, if `iCount` is 3 and `iInterval` is 100, then one frame will be captured immediately, another after 1/10sec, and a third after a further 1/10sec.| 
 
**Returns**
 
Zero if successful, non-zero if there was an error.
 #### int changeSubtitleFD (AssetFileDescriptor afd)

Open the caption resource file which is attached in "res/raw" or "assets" folder.

Access should be provided by AssetFileDescriptor. Length and Offset will be calculated internally.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---|
| afd | Asset file descriptor|
 
**Returns**

The status of the operation: this is zero in the case of success, or a non-zero NexPlayer error code in the case of failure.
 
> **Warning** When building the APK, most of resources will be compressed. This makes it difficult to extract FileDescriptor. To avoid compressing, you MUST change your fileâ€™s extension. These extensions are allowed: ".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png", ".gif", ".wav", ".mp2", ".mp3", ".ogg", ".aac", ".mpg", ".mpeg", ".mid", ".midi", ".smf", ".jet", ".rtttl", ".imy", ".xmf", ".mp4", ".m4a", ".m4v", ".3gp", ".3gpp", ".3g2", ".3gpp2", ".amr", ".awb", ".wma", ".wmv"
 
  
#### int close ()

This method ends all the work on the content currently open and closes content data.

The content must be stopped before calling this method.

The correct way to finish playing content is to either wait for the end of content, or to call stop and wait for the stop operation to complete, then call close.

> **Warning** However, do not call close in IListenerâ€™s event handlers as this may give rise to a deadlock. A safe way to call close is to use the Android UI main threadâ€™s message handler.
 
**Returns**

Zero for success, or a non-zero NexPlayer error code in the event of a failure.
 
#### native int disableDynamicThumbnail ()

This method disables the Dynamic Thumbnail feature, if enabled.

> **Warning** The Dynamic Thumbnail feature must be disabled by calling this method before calling `NexPlayer.close` when a player is being closed.
 
**Returns**

Zero if successful, or an error code in the event of failure.
 
#### void disableUnsupportedResolutions ()

This method removes the unsupported video resolutions based on the native MediaCodec video capability information.

If the track has lower resolution than the one reported by the MediaCodecInfo API, then that track will be ignored and wonâ€™t be played.

This feature only works for API Level 21 and above

#### native int DownloaderClose()

This method is called to close a Downloader event.

Note that this method cannot be called until after initializing NexPlayer by calling init(). Anytime DownloaderOpen() is called, this method must also be called properly close the Downloader module. If a call is also made to DownloaderStart(), then DownloaderStop() must be called BEFORE calling DownloaderClose() to properly end the event.

**Returns**

Zero if successful, or an error code in the event of failure.
 
#### native int DownloaderGetInfo(Object info)

This method is called to get information about a Downloader event.

Note that this method cannot be called until after initializing NexPlayer by calling init().

**Returns**
 
Zero if successful, or an error code in the event of failure.
 
#### native int DownloaderStart ( )

This method is called to start downloading and saving content in a Downloader event.

Note that this method cannot be called until after both initializing NexPlayer by calling init() and opening an event in the Downloader module with DownloaderOpen().

**Returns**
 
Zero if successful, or an error code in the event of failure.
 
#### native int DownloaderStop()

This method is called to stop downloading and saving content in a Downloader event.

Note that this method cannot be called until after initializing NexPlayer by calling init(). Anytime a call is made to `DownloaderStart()`, it must be matched by a call to this method to properly stop and finish a Downloader event.

**Returns**

Zero if successful, or an error code in the event of failure.

#### native int enableDynamicThumbnail()

This method is used to enable and apply the Dynamic Thumbnail feature for Smooth Streaming content.

Refer to the following steps to use this method accurately:

1. The `enableDynamicThumbnail()` method should be called before `NexPlayer.open`.
2. When open completes, use the `getContentInfo()` method to get the total playtime of the content. By dividing the extracted total playtime value by the number of the thumbnail buffer array from the UI (the number of available thumbnails), the interval time is determined. The interval time can then be used with the `setOptionDynamicThumbnail()` method to get thumbnail information.
3. If the setting above works normally, NexPlayer will use the `onDynamicThumbnailData()` method to send thumbnail data to the UI.
4. The `disableDynamicThumbnail()` method should be called before `NexPlayer.close` when closing content.
5. If a video track is changed while content is playing, these methods should be called in the following order:
    - FIRST, `disableDynamicThumbnail()`
    - SECOND, `enableDynamicThumbnail()` to enable Dynamic Thumbnails for the new content, and
    - LASTLY, `setOptionDynamicThumbnail(OPTION_DYNAMIC_THUMBNAIL_INTERVAL, interval_time, 0)` to set the appropriate interval for the new thumbnails.

**Returns**
 
Zero if successful, or an error code in the event of failure.
 
 
#### native int fastPlaySetPlaybackRate(float rate)

This function sets the video playback rate for thefastPlayfeature.

HLS video content will be played at the speed set by the playback rate when the fastPlay feature is activated
by calling fastPlayStart. This rate can be set to any float value (excluding zero), where positive values
will play content back at a faster speed and negative values will rewind content at the set rate faster than normal playback speed.

If rate is set to zero, this method will return an error.

**Parameters**
 
 
| Name | Description | 
|---|---|
| rate | The speed at which video will play in `fastPlay` mode. This speed is indicated by any float value (but NOT zero), where negative values rewind the video at faster than normal playback speed and positive values play the video faster than normal (like fast forward). For example:<br><br>- rate = 3.0 (fastPlay plays video at 3x normal speed)<br>- rate = - 2.0 (fastPlay rewinds video at 2x normal speed)| 

**Returns**
 
Zero for success, or a non-zero NexPlayer error code in the event of a failure.
  
#### native int fastPlayStart (int msec, float rate)

This method activates thefastPlayfeature in HLS content.

> **Warning**  This method can be used in HLS content only.
 
The `fastPlay` feature allows NexPlayer to play HLS content at a speed other than normal playback speed.
WhenfastPlayis activated, content is played more quickly than normal and there is no audio (similar to a fast forward feature).

The player can also rewind quickly through HLS content using the fastPlay feature by setting the `rate` parameter to a negative value.

To change the speed or direction of thefastPlayfeature, simply call the fastPlaySetPlaybackRate method and
change therateparameter to the desired value.

**Parameters**
 
| Name | Description | 
|---|---|
| msec |The time in the content at which to startfastPlay(inmsec(milliseconds)). |
| rate | The speed at which video will play in `fastPlay` mode. This speed is indicated by any float value (but NOT zero), where negative values rewind the video at faster than normal playback speed and positive values play the video faster than normal (like fast forward). For example:<br><br>- rate = 3.0 (fastPlay plays video at 3x normal speed)<br>- rate = - 2.0 (fastPlay rewinds video at 2x normal speed)| 

**Returns**
 
Zero for success, or a non-zero NexPlayer error code in the event of a failure.
 
#### int fastPlayStop (boolean bResume)

This function turns off thefastPlayfeature in HLS content.

Once the `fastPlay` feature has been activated by calling fastPlayStart, this method must be called in order to stop fastPlay.

In order to reactivate the fastPlay feature after calling fastPlayStop, simply call the fastPlayStart method again. If fastPlayStop is called when fastPlay is not activated, an error will be returned.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---|
| bResume | This boolean value sets whether to resume playback after fastPlay or not. If bResume = 1, video will automatically resume playback when fastPlay stops. If bResume= 0, when fastPlay stops, the content in NexPlayer will be paused.|
 
**Returns**

Zero for success, or a non-zero NexPlayer error code in the event of a failure.
 
#### native int getAudioSessionId()

This method gets an audio session ID in order to use Androidâ€™s audio effects with NexPlayer.
 
This API allows NexPlayer to support use of the Android audio effects like the Android Audio Equalizer. This method should be called before using any audio effect.

**Returns**

An audio session ID as an integer.
    

#### int getClientStatus ( int id)

This method gets the current status of a client module integrated into the NexPlayer SDK.

> **Warning** Note that client modules are optional features of the NexPlayer SDK. For more information on how to integrate and use a client module available in the SDK (as well as sample code), please see the relevant NexXXXClient class.
 
**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---|
|id | The client ID as an integer.|
 
**Returns**

0 if the status of the client is normal, -1 if the client has an error, and 1 if the client module has not been initialized.
 
**See Also**
 
- addNexClient
- removeNexClient
 
#### NexContentInformation getContentInfo()

This function retrieves information from the current content.

> **Note** The `getContentInfoInt` function also returns information on the current content. In some cases, the same information is available through both functions. However, some items are available only through one of the functions.
 
**PERFORMANCE NOTE:** This allocates a new instance of NexContentInformation every time it is called,
which may place a burden on the garbage collector in some cases. If you need to access multiple fields, save the returned object in a variable. For cases that are particularly sensitive to performance, selected content information is available through getContentInfoInt, which doesnâ€™t allocate any objects.

**Returns**
 
A NexContentInformation object containing information on the currently open content.
 
**See Also**

getContentInfoInt

#### native int getContentInfoInt(int info\_index)

Retrieves the specified content information item.

In most cases, this is equivalent to calling getContentInfo and accessing an individual field in the return value.

However, there are a few items that are only available through this method, and for items available through both methods, this one may be more efficient in certain cases. SeegetContentInfofor more information.

Certain fields (such as the list of tracks) are only available through the full structure, and certain fields (such as frames displayed per second) are only available here.

**Content Info Indexes:** The following integer constants identify different content information items that are available; they are passed in the info\_index argument to specify which content information item the caller is interested in.

**Also available in `getContentInfo`:**

- **CONTENT\_INFO\_INDEX\_MEDIA\_TYPE (0)** Same as the mMediaType member ofNexContentInfo
- **CONTENT\_INFO\_INDEX\_MEDIA\_DURATION (1)** Same as the mMediaDuration member ofNexContentInfo
- **CONTENT\_INFO\_INDEX\_VIDEO\_CODEC (2)** Same as the mVideoCodec member ofNexContentInfo
- **CONTENT\_INFO\_INDEX\_VIDEO\_WIDTH (3)** Same as the mVideoWidth member ofNexContentInfo

- **CONTENT\_INFO\_INDEX\_AUDIO\_BITRATE (10)** Same as the mAudioBitRate member of NexContentInfo
- **CONTENT\_INFO\_INDEX\_MEDIA\_ISSEEKABLE (11)** Same as the mIsSeekable member ofNexContentInfo
- **CONTENT\_INFO\_INDEX\_MEDIA\_ISPAUSABLE (12)** Same as the mIsPausable member of NexContentInfo
- **CONTENT\_INFO\_INDEX\_VIDEO\_FOURCC (13)** Same as the mVideoFourCC member of NexContentInfo
- **CONTENT\_INFO\_INDEX\_VIDEO\_CODEC\_CLASS (14)** Same as the mVideoCodecClass member of NexContentInfo
- **CONTENT\_INFO\_INDEX\_VIDEO\_PROFILE (15)** Same as the mVideoProfile member of NexContentInfo
- **CONTENT\_INFO\_INDEX\_VIDEO\_LEVEL (16)** Same as the mIsVideoLevel member of NexContentInfo
- **CONTENT\_INFO\_INDEX\_VIDEO\_CODEC\_ERROR (17)** Same as the VideoCodecErrormember of NexContentInfo

**Video Performance Information (Available only via `getContentInfoInt`):** The NexPlayer engine reads
frames from the content, then decodes and displays each frame. If the device is not powerful enough for the
resolution or bitrate being played, the decoding or display of some frames may be skipped in order to maintain synchronization with the audio track.

The values of the parameters in this section provide information about the number of frames actually being displayed. Per-second averages are calculated every two seconds (although this interval may change in future releases). Frame counts reset at the same interval, so the ratio is generally more meaningful than the actual numbers (since the interval may change). Running totals are also provided, and are updated at the same interval.

If you wish to perform your own calculations or average over other intervals, you can periodically sample the running totals. Running totals are reset when new content is opened.

- **CONTENT\_INFO\_INDEX\_VIDEO\_RENDER\_AVE\_FPS (1000)** Average number of video frames per second decoded. This number was multiplied by 10, so you should divide by 10.
- **CONTENT\_INFO\_INDEX\_VIDEO\_RENDER\_AVE\_DSP (1001)** Average number of video frames per second actually displayed. This number was multiplied by 10, so you should divide by 10.
- **CONTENT\_INFO\_INDEX\_VIDEO\_RENDER\_COUNT (1002)** Number of video frames displayed.
- **CONTENT\_INFO\_INDEX\_VIDEO\_RENDER\_TOTAL\_COUNT (1003)** Total number of video frames displayed.
- **CONTENT\_INFO\_INDEX\_VIDEO\_CODEC\_DECODING\_COUNT (1004)** Number of video frames decoded during the last interval.
- **CONTENT\_INFO\_INDEX\_VIDEO\_CODEC\_DECODING\_TOTAL\_COUNT (1005)** Total number of video frames decoded.
- **CONTENT\_INFO\_INDEX\_VIDEO\_CODEC\_AVG\_DECODE\_TIME (1006)** Average time to decode video frames.
- **CONTENT\_INFO\_INDEX\_VIDEO\_CODEC\_AVG\_RENDER\_TIME (1007)** Average time to render video frames.
- **CONTENT\_INFO\_INDEX\_VIDEO\_CODEC\_DECODE\_TIME (1008)** Time taken to decode one video frame.
- **CONTENT\_INFO\_INDEX\_VIDEO\_CODEC\_RENDER\_TIME (1009)** Time taken to render one video frame.
- **CONTENT\_INFO\_INDEX\_VIDEO\_AVG\_BITRATE (1010)** Average bitrate of video currently playing.
- **CONTENT\_INFO\_INDEX\_VIDEO\_FRAMEBYTES (1011)** Total size of video frames, in bytes.
- **CONTENT\_INFO\_INDEX\_AUDIO\_AVG\_BITRATE (1012)** Average bitrate of audio currently playing.
- **CONTENT\_INFO\_INDEX\_AUDIO\_FRAMEBYTES (1013)** Total size of audio frames, in bytes.
- **CONTENT\_INFO\_INDEX\_VIDEO\_FRAME\_COUNT (1014)** Number of video frames available to be decoded during the last interval.
- **CONTENT\_INFO\_INDEX\_VIDEO\_TOTAL\_FRAME\_COUNT (1015)** Total number of video frames to decode.

For example, to determine the number of B-frames skipped in the previous interval simply calculate CONTENT\_INFO\_INDEX\_VIDEO\_FRAME\_COUNT - CONTENT\_INFO\_INDEX\_VIDEO\_CODEC\_DECODING\_COUNT.

Also note that CONTENT\_INFO\_INDEX\_VIDEO\_CODEC\_DECODING\_COUNT - CONTENT\_INFO\_INDEX\_VIDEO\_RENDER\_COUNT can be used to determine how many frames were decoded but were not rendered due to performance limitations.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---|
| info\_index |The integer index of the content information item to return. This is one of the CONTENT\_INFO\_INDEX\_ constants described above.|
 
**Returns**
 
The integer value of the requested content information item.

#### native int getCurrentPosition()

This method gets the current play time position of NexPlayer in the given content.

This method can be called at any time to check the current position.

**Returns**
 
The current play time position inmsec(milliseconds).

#### String getDetailedError()

This method provides a string of information when a network or protocol error occurs, such as a timeout due to a connection delay.

If the category of the NexErrorCode is Network or Protocol, or a timeout such as SOURCE\_OPEN\_TIMEOUT /
DATA\_INACTIVITY\_TIMEOUT by NEXPLAYER\_EVENT\_DATA\_INACTIVITY\_TIMEOUT, the string will be filled.

> **Warning** NexProperty.ENABLE\_DETAIL\_ERROR should be enabled to get this information
 
**Returns**
 
Returns a string of information for Network or Protocol errors, an empty string if none.
 
#### native int GetNearestIFramePos ( int targetTS)

This method returns the nearest I-Frame timestamp in front of the target position when seeking.

It can get the nearest timestamp of I-Frame in front of target position to use highlight function.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---| 
|targetTS | A pointer to the timestamp of the target position.|
 
**Returns**
 
Zero or a positive number if successful, a negative number if there was an error.
 
#### int getProgramTime(PROGRAM\_TIME time)

This method gets the date and time information in HLS content when the HLS tag, #EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME,
is included.

The same information is also returned approximately once a second by the IListener event, onProgramTime. It can be used to determine the current time of the frame and help when syncing content and text or when determining when to play text.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---|
|time| The program time information of the current decoding frame as a PROGRAM\_TIME object.|
 
**Returns**
 
Always zero.
 
**See Also**

- PROGRAM\_TIME for more details
- IListener.onProgramTime
  
 
#### native int GetRenderMode ()

Returns the type of renderer in use by the NexPlayer engine.

You must check the render mode using this method and adjust the application behavior appropriately. For details see Java Renderer or OpenGL Renderer.

When using the Java renderer (NEX\_USE\_RENDER\_JAVA), the application must NOT callsetOutputPosor
setDisplay. Doing so may cause the application to crash if running under Honeycomb.

When using the OpenGL renderer (NEX\_USE\_RENDER\_OPENGL), the application must NOT callsetDisplay.

**Returns**
 
Render mode; one of:
 
- **NEX\_USE\_RENDER\_AND** Using only standard Android API bitmaps to display frames.
- **NEX\_USE\_RENDER\_JAVA** Donâ€™t render to the display. Instead, each frame is decoded and converted
    to the appropriate color space, and then sent to the application to display.
- **NEX\_USE\_RENDER\_OPENGL** Using OpenGL ES 2.0 to display frames.
- **NEX\_USE\_RENDER\_IOMX** Using the hardware video renderer to display frames. Note that this ren-
    derer is used with Ice Cream Sandwich and higher versions of OS and only on supported hardware.

#### native String getSARInfo()

This method retrieves the SAR (Sample Aspect Ratio) of H.264 content when specified.

The sample aspect ratio (SAR) returned by this method is expressed as a ratio of the width of the sample size to the height of the sample size. It can be used to appropriately display content to the user.

This sample aspect ratio will be one of the following ratios:

1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 2:1, 12:11, 10:11, 40:33, 24:11, 20:11, 32:11, 80:33, 18:11, 15:11, 64:33, or 160:99.

Note that if SAR information is not specified for given H.264 content, the returned ratio will also be 1:1.

To retrieve the SAR information as integers, the method `getSARInfo(int[] info)` should be called instead.

For more information about the SAR information included in H.264 content, please consult Table E-1 - Meaning of Sample Aspect Ratio Indicator on page 374 of the H.264 specifications (Rec. ITU-T H.264 (03/2010).

**Returns**

 
The sample aspect ratio of the content as a string, for example "1:1".
 
**See Also**
 
getSARInfo(int[])
 
#### void getSARInfo(int[] info)

This method can be used to retrieve the SAR (Sample Aspect Ratio) information of H.264 content as separate
integers.

To receive the SAR as a string, the method getSARInfo() should be called instead. The first element of the
getSARInfo integer array will be the aspect width of the sample and the second element will be the aspect height of
the sample.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---| 
|info| An integer array of 2 elements where the first is the aspect width of the sample and the
second is the height.|

getSARInfo()
 
5.91.3.49 native String getSDKName()

This method returns the name of the NexPlayer SDK in use. It can be used for confirmation and for debugging purposes but should generally be ignored.

**Returns**
 
The name of the NexPlayer SDK as a string.
 
#### long[] getSeekableRangeInfo()

This method returns the range of the current content that is seekable.

This method is used to allow NexPlayer to support timeshifting playback within HLS Live and Smooth Streaming content. Based on the amount of content available from the server at a particular time, it determines the seekable range within the playing content which also indicates the range where playback may be timeshifted. This range will be constantly shifting as the live streaming content available from the server changes in real time, so this method will need to be repeatedly called to ensure accurate shifting of playback.

For local content this method will always return the same two values, and the second value indicating the end of the seekable range will continuously change in progressive download (PD) content, but this method is most relevant when playing live streaming content, as with HLS and Smooth Streaming.

For more information about how this method may be used to timeshift playback in live content, please also refer to the introductory section on time shift support.

**Returns**

An array of twolongs, the firstlongbeing the timestamp indicating the start of the seekable range and the
second being the timestamp indicating the end of the seekable range.
 
#### native int getState()

This method retrieves the current state of NexPlayer.

Calling methods such as open and start does not immediately change the state. The state changes asynchronously, and the new state goes into effect at the same time onAsyncCmdComplete is called to notify the application.

**Returns**
 
A constant indicating the current state. This is one of the following **Values:**
 
- NEXPLAYER\_STATE\_CLOSED
- NEXPLAYER\_STATE\_NONE
- NEXPLAYER\_STATE\_PAUSE
- NEXPLAYER\_STATE\_PLAY
- NEXPLAYER\_STATE\_STOP
 
#### native int getVersion(int mode)

Gets NexPlayer SDK version information.

The return value is an integer; the meaning is based on themodeargument passed.

Generally, the components of the version are assembled as follows:

```java
String versionString = nexPlayer.getVersion(0) + "." +
nexPlayer.getVersion(1) + "." +
nexPlayer.getVersion(2) + "." +
nexPlayer.getVersion(3);
```

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---|
|mode| Version information to return. This must be one of the following values (other values are reserved and should not be used): <br>- 0 : Major version<br>- 1 : Minor version<br>- 2 : Patch version<br>- 3 : Build version|

**Returns**

Requested version information (seemodeabove).
 
#### native int GLInit ( int width,int height)

Informs NexPlayer of the current size of the GLSurfaceView subclass instance.

This should be called whenever the size of theGLSurfaceViewsubclass instance changes, as well as when the
instance is initially created. This is because internally, OpenGL APIs use a different coordinate system, and NexPlayer must know the pixel dimensions in order to map the OpenGL coordinate system to per-pixel coordinates.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---| 
|width| Width ofGLSurfaceViewsubclass instance, in pixels.|
|height| Height ofGLSurfaceViewsubclass instance, in pixels.|
 
**Returns**

Always 0, but may change in future versions. The return value should be ignored.
 
#### int gotoCurrentLivePosition()

This method moves to the current live position after the actual playback position.

Normally, when playing live content, previously recorded data (for example, a few seconds earlier than the actual live position) is played to avoid buffering. This method however ignores this concept and moves directly to the latest loaded playback position (where the server is currently being encoded).

This method behaves in the same way as the method gotoCurrentLivePosition(boolean exact) with the parameter,
exact, set totrue. In other words, NexPlayer will seek exactly to the time specified bymsec(milliseconds).

**Returns**
 
Zero for success, or a non-zero NexPlayer error code in the event of a failure.
 
#### native int gotoCurrentLivePosition(boolean exact)

This method moves to the current live position after the actual playback position.

Normally, when playing live content, previously recorded data (for example, a few seconds earlier than the actual live position) to avoid buffering. This method however ignores this concept and moves directly to the latest loaded playback position (where the server is currently being encoded).

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---| 
|exact| If exact is true, the player will seek exactly to the time specified bymsec(milliseconds). Otherwise, the playhead will seek to the nearest approximate position for faster seeking performance. |
 
**Returns**

Zero for success, or a non-zero NexPlayer error code in the event of a failure.
 
#### NexErrorCode init (Context context)

This method initializes NexPlayer.

This must be called **after** NexPlayer.setNexALFactory has been called. This can be done for example by using:

```java
mNexALFactory.init(this, strModel, strRenderMode, 0, colorDepth);
mNexPlayer.setNexALFactory(mNexALFactory);
mNexPlayer.init(this);
```

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---| 
|context| The current context; from Activity subclasses, you can just pass this.|
 
**Returns**
 
NexPlayer error code for the generated error.
 
#### NexErrorCode init (Context context, int logLevel)

This method initializes NexPlayer.

This must be called **after** NexPlayer.setNexALFactory has been called. This can be done for example by using:

```java
mNexALFactory.init(this, strModel, strRenderMode, 0, colorDepth);
mNexPlayer.setNexALFactory(mNexALFactory);
mNexPlayer.init(this, 0)
```

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---| 
|context| The current context; fromActivitysubclasses, you can just pass this.|
|logLevel| NexPlayer SDK logging level. This affects the messages that the SDK writes to the Android log.<br>**-1** : Do not output any log messages.<br>**0** : Output basic log messages only (recommended).<br>**1** âˆ¼ **4** : Output detailed log messages; higher numbers result in more verbose log entries, but may cause performance issues in some cases and are not recommended for general release code.|

**Returns**

NexErrorCode.NONE if initialization succeeded; NexPlayer errorcode for the generated error in
the case of a failure (in the case of failure, check the log for details).
 
 
#### boolean isInitialized ( )

Determines if NexPlayer is currently initialized.

To initialize NexPlayer, NexPlayer.init must be called. If that method returnstrue, then this method will also return true if called on the same instance of NexPlayer.

In some cases, it is necessary to call NexPlayer functions from event handlers in subclasses ofActivity(such as `onPause` or `onStop`). In such event handlers, it is possible for them to be called before code that initializes NexPlayer, or for them to be called after a failed initialization. Therefore, any calls to NexPlayer methods made from onPause or similar event handlers must be protected as follows:

```java
if( nexPlayer.isInitialized()) {
// Calls to other methods are safe here
}
```
**Returns**
 
true if NexPlayer is currently initialized.
 
#### native int notifyHeadsetState(int uiOnOff)

This method notifies the NexPlayer engine whether a wired headset has been plugged in or unplugged.

When the ENHANCED\_SOUND\_AVAILABILITY property is set equal to 1 and more, this method must be called
(1) before calling NexPlayer.start() and (2) every time the state of the headset changes.

For example:

```java
if (intent.getAction().equals(Intent.ACTION\_HEADSET\_PLUG))
{
int headSetState = intent.getExtras().getInt("state");
// 0 : unplugged 1 : plug in
mNexPlayer.notifyHeadsetState(headSetState);
}
```

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---|
|uiOnOff| An integer indicating whether enhanced sound ison(a headset is plugged in) or off(the headset is unplugged) when enhanced sound is available in the NexPlayer SDK. Possible **Values:**<br>- on = 1<br>- off = 0|

**Returns**
 
Zero is successful or a non-zero error code.
 
5.91.3.63 void onOfflineExpiredKeyFetchMode(bool eansetMode)

This method switch using either KEYEXPIRE\_RETRIEVE\_STORE mode or RETRIEVE mode when only using
Offline Playback on media DRM.

> **Warning** This must be called beforeNexPlayer.open.
 
**Parameters**
 
| Name | Description | 
|---|---|
|setMode| TRUE to setting KEYEXPIRE\_RETRIEVE\_STORE mode, FALSE to setting RETRIEVE mode. when Offline Playback |
 
#### int open (String path, String smiPath, String externalPDPath, int type, int transportType)

This method begins opening the media at the specified path or URL.

This supports both local content and streaming content.

When the stored info file is created by using NexOfflineStoreController and then passed to the path parameter, this method opens content for offline playback.

This is an asynchronous operation that will run in the background (even for local content).

When this operation completes, `onAsyncCmdComplete` is called with one of the following command constants
(depending on thetypespecified in the open call):

- NEXPLAYER\_ASYNC\_CMD\_OPEN\_LOCAL
- NEXPLAYER\_ASYNC\_CMD\_OPEN\_STREAMING
- NEXPLAYER\_ASYNC\_CMD\_OPEN\_STORE\_STREAM

Success or failure of the operation can be determined by checking theresultargument passed toonAsync-
CmdComplete. If the result is 0, the media was successfully opened; if it is any other value, the operation failed.

Calls to open must be matched with calls to NexPlayer.close.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---|
|path| The location of the content: a path (for local content) or URL (for remote content).|
|smiPath| The path to a local subtitle file, the URL to load a subtitle file, or null for no subtitles. For streaming content that already includes subtitles, this should benull(using both types of subtitles at the same time will cause undefined behavior).|
|externalPDPath | When not null, the external path used to play PD content downloaded by the Downloader module. This is only available for content in MP4 containers. |
|type | This determines how the path argument is interpreted. This will be one of: <br>`NEXPLAYER_SOURCE_TYPE_LOCAL_NORMAL` to play local media (the path is a local file system path)<br>`NEXPLAYER_SOURCE_TYPE_STREAMING` to play remote media sources (including RTSP streaming, progressive download and HTTP Live streaming). The path is interpreted as a URL.<br>`NEXPLAYER_SOURCE_TYPE_STORE_STREAM` to store remote media content (only currently available with HTTP Live streaming (HLS) content and not supported for live content) for later offline playback.    Other NEXPLAYER\_SOURCE\_âˆ—values are not supported in this version and should not be used.|
| transportType | The network transport type to use on the connection. This should be one of:<br>`NEXPLAYER_TRANSPORT_TYPE_TCP`<br>`NEXPLAYER_TRANSPORT_TYPE_UDP`|

**Returns**

The status of the operation: this is zero in the case of success, or a non-zero NexPlayer error code in the
case of failure.
 
> **Note** This only indicates the success or failure ofstartingthe operation. Even if this reports success, the operation may still fail later, asynchronously, in which case the application is notified in onAsyncCmdComplete.
 

#### int openFD (AssetFileDescriptor afd)

Open the media resource file which is attached in "res/raw" or "assets" folder Access should be provided by AssetFileDescriptor.

Length and Offset will be calculated internally.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---| 
|afd| Asset file descriptor.|
 
**Returns**
 
The status of the operation: this is zero in the case of success, or a non-zero NexPlayer error code in the
case of failure.
 
> **Warning** When building the APK, most of resources will be compressed. This makes it difficult to extract FileDescriptor. To avoid compressing, you MUST change your fileâ€™s extension. Below extensions are allowed: ".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png", ".gif", ".wav", ".mp2", ".mp3", ".ogg", ".aac", ".mpg", ".mpeg", ".mid", ".midi", ".smf", ".jet", ".rtttl", ".imy", ".xmf", ".mp4", ".m4a", ".m4v", ".3gp", ".3gpp", ".3g2", ".3gpp2", ".amr", ".awb", ".wma", ".wmv"
 
#### int openFD ( FileDescriptor fd,long offset,long length)

Open the resource files which are attached in "res/raw" or "assets" folder.

Length and Offset can be acquired from the UI.

When the stored info file is created by using NexOfflineStoreController and then passed to the path parameter, this method opens content for offline playback.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---|
|fd |File descriptor.|
|offset| Offset.|
|length| Length.|
 
**Returns**

The status of the operation: this is zero in the case of success, or a non-zero NexPlayer error code in the
case of failure.

#### int pause()

This method pauses the current playback.

Please note that when the hardware codec is in use, if the application is sent to the background by pressing the home button, pausing and resuming playback may return an error because of resource limitations. To avoid this potential issue, stopping and starting playback is recommended in algorithm handling this specific case of the application being sent to the background because the home button was pressed.

**Returns**

Zero for success, or a non-zero NexPlayer error code in the event of a failure.
 
#### native int playspeedcontrol(float fPlaySeed)

This method controls the playback speed of content by the given percent.

> **Note** Speed Control is an optional feature. This method makes it possible to allow users to adjust the playback speed of content, from a quarter of the original speed to double speed, by changing the value of the parameter fPlaySeed. For example, to play content at half-speed,fPlaySeedshould be set to 0.5
 
This method doesnâ€™t work if it is called when NexPlayer is stopped.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---| 
|fPlaySeed| This float represents the percentage by which to change the playback speed. It must be in
the range of 0.25 to 2.0, which adjusts the playback speed from 0.25x to 2x the original speed
of the content.|
 
> **Warning** When using this method with HLS or Smooth Streaming content, playing multitrack content may cause unstable performance. Therefore, playing content as a single track is encouraged.
 
#### native int reconnectNetwork()

This method allows NexPlayer to reconnect to the media server in the case of streaming content.

It allows NexPlayer to reconnect to a media server when network conditions may have closed a connection.

> **Warning** This is only supported in HLS, DASH, SmoothStreaming and PD streaming content.
 
**Returns**

Zero if successful or a non-zero error code.
 

#### void release()

This method releases resources used by the NexPlayer instance.

This should be called when the instance is no longer needed. After calling this method, the instance can no longer be used, and methods on it should not be called, except for getState which will return `NEXPLAYER_STATE_NONE.`

#### boolean removeEventReceiver(NexEventReceiver receiver)

This removes a receiver which was added withaddEventReceiver.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---|
|receiver| The object to which methods will be called when events occur.|
 
**See Also**

- NexEventReceiver
- NexPlayer.addReleaseListener
 
#### NexClient removeNexClient ( int client\_id)

This method removes a client module integrated into the NexPlayer SDK.

Note that client modules are optional features of the NexPlayer SDK. For more information on how to integrate and use a client module available in the SDK (as well as sample code), please see the relevant NexXXXClient class.

> **Warning** When NexPlayer is released, the client will be removed automatically.
 
**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---|
|client\_id| The ID of the client module as an integer. This is the return value ofaddNexClient().|
 
**Returns**
 
The removed client module as aNexClientobject.
 
**See Also**
 
- addNexClient
- getClientStatus
 
#### void removeReleaseListener (IReleaseListener listener)

Removes a callback listener which was added withaddReleaseListener.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---|
|listener| The object on which methods will be called when the instance of NexPlayer is released.|
 
**See Also**

- NexPlayer.IReleaseListener
- NexPlayer.addReleaseListener
 
#### int resume ()

This method resumes playback beginning at the point at which the player was last paused.

**Returns**
 
Zero for success, or a non-zero NexPlayer error code in the event of a failure.
 
#### native int seek ( int msec,boolean exact)

This method seeks the playback position to the specified time.

This doesnâ€™t work if NexPlayer is stopped or if the stream doesnâ€™t support seeking, but does work if NexPlayer is playing or paused.

Note that even if the parameterexactisTRUE, it is possible to minimize seek time by adjusting the NexProperty SEEK\_RANGE\_FROM\_RA\_POINT.

Note that NexPlayerâ€™s state will be changed to pause and resume automatically if this method is called during playback. Therefore, if getState is calling while NexPlayer is seeking, the UI can get NEXPLAYER\_STATE\_PAUSE.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---|
|msec| The offset inmsec(milliseconds) from the beginning of the media to which the playback position should seek.|
|exact| If exact is true, the player will seek exactly to the time specified bymsec(milliseconds). Otherwise, the playhead will seek to the nearest approximate position for faster seeking performance.
 
**Returns**

Zero for success, or a non-zero NexPlayer error code in the event of a failure.
 
**See Also**
 
NexProperty.SEEK\_RANGE\_FROM\_RA\_POINT
 
#### int seek (int msec)

This function seeks the playback position exactly to a specific time.

This doesnâ€™t work if NexPlayer is stopped or if the stream doesnâ€™t support seeking, but does work if NexPlayer is playing or paused.

This method behaves in the same way as the method seek(int msec, boolean exact) with the second parameter,
exact, set totrue. In other words, NexPlayer will seek exactly to the time specified bymsec(milliseconds).

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---|
|msec| The offset in milliseconds from the beginning of the media to which the playback position should seek.|
 
**Returns**

Zero for success, or a non-zero NexPlayer error code in the event of a failure.
 
**See Also**
 
NexPlayer.seek(int msec, boolean exact)
 
#### native int setAudioPitch ( int iPitchIndex)

This method sets the pitch control settings for audio in content.

> **Note** Audio pitch control is an optional feature in the NexPlayer SDK.
 
The pitch of audio in content is adjusted compared to the original pitch of the audio. SettingiPitchIndex= 0
will not change the pitch, but with each integer step, the pitch will be adjusted by another semitone.

For example, if the original audio has a pitch of C, then withiPitchIndex= 1, the new pitch set will be a semitone higher than the original, or C sharp (D flat). Similarly, if the pitch is to be lower than the original,iPitchIndex should be set to a negative value (in particular, for original audio with a pitch of C,iPitchIndex= -2 will change the pitch to A sharp (B flat)).

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---| 
|iPitchIndex| The index of the pitch to apply to the content, where 0 is no change in pitch, and each other
integer value indicates an additional semitone change in pitch away from the original audio.
Range of pitch control (index): {-12, -11, -10, ... -1, 0, 1, ... 10, 11, 12} |
 
**Returns**

Zero if successful, or an error code in the case of failure.
 
#### native int setAutoVolume ( int uiOnOff)

This method turns the Auto Volume featureonoroff, but this feature is only available in some product categories.

> **Note** Auto Volume is an optional feature.
 
When Auto Volume is turnedon, NexPlayer automatically adjusts the volume level of different content so that
it is played at a consistent and optimal volume level, allowing the user to play different content without having to constantly adjust the volume when new content starts.

By default, Auto Volume is turnedoff(identical to the behavior of the player in product categories that do not support this feature).

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---| 
|uiOnOff| This turns the Auto Volume featureonand. By default, this feature isoff= 0.<br>Possible **Values:** <br>- on= 1<br>- off= 0|

**Returns**
 
The new value of Auto Volume. If Auto Volume was turnedoff, this will be 0.
If Auto Volume was turnedon, it will return 1.
If Auto Volume is not supported in this version of the NexPlayer, this will return the error, NOT\_SUPPORT
(0x8000000FL).
 
#### native int SetBitmap (Object mFrameBitmap)

Sets a bitmap to be used to receive rendered frames for display, when using the Java-based renderer.

For more information on this method, please also refer to theJava Renderersection of the NexPlayer Engine
documentation.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---| 
|mFrameBitmap| The bitmap to receive rendered frames (when using Java-based renderer).|
 
**Returns**

Always 0, but may change in future versions. The return value should be ignored.
  
#### int setClientTimeShift (boolean bEnable, String strFileBufferPath, int uiTimeShiftBufferSize,int uiTimeShiftDuration)

This method enables the client time shift feature in the NexPlayer SDK.

Time shifting is a feature to store realtime data as it is received so that the user can watch past data while playing live content. When this feature is enabled, NexPlayer prepares for the time shift and only afterpauseis called, it stores received data from a live stream in local file storage with the specified buffer size and duration set with this API. As a result, the user can seek and pause even when the content playing is live. This method will be stopped when the methodgotoCurrentLivePositionis called.

> **Note** This method should be called between calls toinit()andopen(). Furthermore, onceopen()is called,
the parameter values cannot be changed unless the application is closed by callingclose()and then
initialized withinit()again.
 
> **Warning** Values for the uiTimeShiftBufferSize and uiTimeShiftDuration parameter should be set
carefully because each device has different capabilities and the NexPlayer SDK canâ€™t guarantee that the
device has enough free space to store data as the user specifies. If storage becomes full and there is no
available space to save the new data, NexPlayer will force the content to resume to use up saved data and
make more storage space available. When the player resumes, onAsyncCmdComplete is called.
 
**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---| 
|bEnable| Sets whether to enable or disable the time shift feature.| 
|strFileBufferPath| The folder name where temporary data for time shifting will be stored when there is no more storage available in the memory buffer. If there is enough memory and no folder is needed, this parameter will be NULL.|
|uiTimeShiftBufferSize|Size of the memory buffer for the time shift feature in megabytes (MB). If the size set to this parameter is bigger than the actual memory available, extra realtime data will be saved in the folder set by the parameterstrFileBufferPath.|
|uiTimeShiftDuration|Maximum duration for the time shift feature, or how much time a user can shift back in live content in minutes.| 
|uiMaxBackwardDuration|Maximum duration for the streaming data backup feature, or how much time (of streamed data files preceding the currenttsfile) can be stored. Normally, streamed data files preceding the latest ts file will be deleted to maintain the allowed memory buffer size. However this parameter allows the streamed data files preceding the latesttsfile to be kept and stored if there is free space available. For example when the available memory buffer is larger than the value set for the parameters `uiTimeShiftBufferSize` or `uiTimeShiftDuration`, this parameter allows users to seek backwards in live content during playback for the specified amount of time. If this parameter is set to the default value 1, streamed data files for the 1 minute preceding the latesttsfile will be kept. If this parameter is set to 0, all
remaining storage space will be available to keep previously streamed data files. When this parameter is set to 0 and the parameterstrFileBufferPathis set to save streamed data in another storage folder, this parameter will be automatically set to 1.
 
**Returns**

Zero if successful, or an error code in the event of failure.
 
**See Also**

gotoCurrentLivePosition
 

#### native int SetContrastBrightness (int Contrast, int Brightness)

This method allows NexPlayer to adjust the contrast and brightness of the displayed content.

These values can be adjusted either from within the code itself or can be set by the user interface. If setting the values within code, it is important to stay **within** the given range of each parameter. Values outside of these ranges will be ignored and the existing value will be retained, but unexpected results could also be potentially produced.

These settings can be continuously adjusted by calling the method multiple times.

> **Warning** This feature is not supported on devices using the HW decoder. To check whether or not the HW decoder is used, check the value of mVideoCodecClass inNexContentInformation. If mVideoCodecClass =
0, this method can be used to adjust contrast and brightness of displayed content.
 
**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---|
|Contrast| This adjusts the contrast of the display. It is an integer from 0 to 255. By default, this value is set to 128.|
|Brightness |This adjusts the brightness of the display. It is an integer from -127 to +128. By default, this value is set to 0.|
 
**Returns**

Always zero, but may change in future versions. The return value should be ignored.
 
#### native int setDebugLogs (int codecLog,int RendererLog,int protocol\_Log)

This method sets the debugging log levels related to codecs, rendering, and protocols in NexPlayer.

> **Warning** Calls to this method should be made after callinginitbut before callingopen.
 
By default, the parameters codecLog and RendererLog are set to -1 so that they are hidden and protocol\_Log is set to 0 so basic logs are produced. However when debugging applications, they can be set to a higher
integer value so that more logs are generated.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---|
|codecLog| The level of logs to be generated related to codecs, as an integer.|
|RendererLog| The level of logs to be generated related to rendering, as an integer.|
|protocol\_Log| The level of logs to be generated related to protocols, as an integer.|
 
**Returns**

Zero if successful or a non-zero error code.
 
#### void setDisplay ( SurfaceHolder sh)

This method sets the surface on which video will be displayed.

> **Warning** This is NOT supported with the Java or OpenGL renderers, and should not be called if one of those renderers is in use.
 
This function actually takes theandroid.view.SurfaceHolderassociated with the surface on which the
video will be displayed.

This function should be called from onVideoRenderPrepared after the surface has been created. In addition, if the surface object changes (for example, if theSurfaceHolderâ€™ssurfaceCreatedcallback is after the initial
setup), this function should be called again to provide the new surface.

If the surface object is destroyed (for example, if theSurfaceHolderâ€™ssurfaceDestroyedcallback is after
the initial setup), this function should be called again to notify that the surface was destroyed.

The surface should match the pixel format of the screen, if possible, or should bet set toPixelFormat.RGB\_-
565.

In general, the surface should be created as follows:

```java
Display display = ((WindowManager) getSystemService(Context.WINDOW_SERVICE)).getDefaultDisplay(); 
int displayPixelFormat = display.getPixelFormat();
SurfaceView surfaceView = new SurfaceView(this); 
SurfaceHolder surfaceHolder = mVideoSurfaceView.getHolder();

if( displayPixelFormat == PixelFormat.RGBA_8888 || 
	displayPixelFormat == PixelFormat.RGBX_8888 ||
	displayPixelFormat == PixelFormat.RGB_888 || 
	displayPixelFormat == 5 ) {
	surfaceHolder.setFormat(PixelFormat.RGBA_8888);
} else {
	surfaceHolder.setFormat(PixelFormat.RGB_565);
}

surfaceHolder.addCallback(new SurfaceHolder.Callback() {

	@Override
	public void surfaceDestroyed(SurfaceHolder holder) {
		mSurfaceExists = false; 
			if( mPlaybackStarted ) {
				mNexPlayer.setDisplay(null); 
		}
	}
	
	@Override
	public void surfaceCreated(SurfaceHolder holder) {
		mSurfaceExists = true;
		if( mPlaybackStarted ) {
			mNexPlayer.setDisplay(holder); }
	   }
	    
	@Override
	public void surfaceChanged(SurfaceHolder holder, int format, int width, int height) {
		// do nothing
	} 
});
```

In `onVideoRenderCreate`, the code should ensure that the surface has already been created before passing the surface holder tosetDisplay. BecauseonViewRenderCreatecan run asynchronously, it may need to wait until the surface is created by sleeping and polling.

For example, if using the example code above,onVideoRenderCreatewould wait untilmSurfaceExists becomes true, using something like:

```java
while(!mSurfaceExists)
	Thread.sleep(10);

nexPlayer.setDisplay(surfaceHolder);
```

It is strongly recommended to use `NexVideoRenderer` instead of using this method directly.


**Parameters**
| Name | Description | 
|---|---|
|sh| Theandroid.view.SurfaceHolderholding the surface on which to display video.|
 
#### int setDisplay (SurfaceHolder sh,int surfaceNumber)

This method sets the surface on which video will be displayed.

This is the same as setDisplay(SurfaceHolder), except that it takes an additional surface number parameter. Currently, only one surface at a time is supported, so this additional parameter must always be zero.

In general, itâ€™s better to use setDisplay(SurfaceHolder).

It is strongly recommended to useNexVideoRendererinstead of using this method directly.

**Parameters**
| Name | Description | 
|---|---|
|sh| Theandroid.view.SurfaceHolderholding the surface on which to display video.|
|surfaceNumber| This integer sets the number of additional surfaces (currently must be zero).|
 
**Returns**

Zero if successful, non-zero if there was an error.

#### void setLicenseRequestListener (INexDRMLicenseListener listener)

Registers a callback that will be invoked when new events occur.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---| 
|listener| INexDRMLicenseListener: the object on which methods will be called when new events occur. This must implement the INexDRMLicenseListenerinterface.|
 
#### void setListener (IListener listener)

Registers a callback that will be invoked when new events occur.

The events dispatched to this callback interface serve three functions:

- to provide new video and audio data to the application, for the application to present to the user.
- to notify the application when a command has completed, so that the application can issue any follow-up commands. For example, issuing start when open has completed.
- to notify the application when there are state changes that the application may wish to reflect in the interface.

All applicationsmustimplement this callback and provide certain minimal functionality. See the IListener documentation for a list of events and information on implementing them.

In an Android application, there are two common idioms for implementing this. The most typical is to have the Activity subclass implement the IListenerinterface.

The other approach is to define an anonymous class in-line:

```java
mNexPlayer.setListener(new NexPlayer.IListener() {
	@Override
	public void onVideoRenderRender(NexPlayer mp) {
	// ...event implementation goes here...
	}
	// ...other methods defined by the interface go here...
});
```
**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---| 
|listener| The object on which methods will be called when new events occur. This must implement the IListenerinterface.|
 
#### int setNetAddrTable(NexNetAddrTable table,int nNetAddrTableType)

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---|
|table| The table to use, containing the hostname and its corresponding custom IP address.|
|nNetAddrTableType| The type of table to be used, setting different options of how to retrieve an IP address with the given host information. This should be one of:|
 
- NETADDR\_TABLE\_OVERRIDE: The table will override existing host database information.
- NETADDR\_TABLE\_FALLBACK: The table will be used as a fallback option to retrieve host information.

**Returns**
 
0 if successfully set; non-zero if there was an error.
 

#### void setNexALFactory (NexALFactoryalFactory)

Sets the NexALFactory in order to inform what type of codec NexPlayer will use.

|param2 | The second parameter of theoptionproperty. If the option being set only needs one parameter, param2 will be NULL.|
 
**Returns**

Zero if successful, or an error code in the event of failure.
 
#### native int setOutputPos ( int iX,int iY,int iWidth,int iHeight)

This method sets the output videoâ€™s position and size.

The position is relative to and within the surface specified in setDisplay or relative to and within the applicationâ€™s OpenGL surface, if the OpenGL renderer is being used.

X and Y are the distances from the upper-left corner. All units are in pixels and are resolution-dependent.

If the video is larger than the surface, or part of it is outside the surface, it will be cropped appropriately. Negative values are therefore acceptable for iX and iY.

> **Warning** setOutputPos is not supported when the render mode is NEX\_USE\_RENDER\_IOMX.
 
**Parameters**

#### native int setProperties(int property,int value)

Sets the value of an individual NexPlayer integer property based on the numerical ID of the property.

Normally, setProperty should be used instead of this method. Use this methodonlyif you have a numeric property code.

For a full list of properties, see the NexProperty enum. To get the numeric code for a property, call the getPropertyCode method on the enum member.

For example:

```java
// enable RTSP support
setProperties(NexProperty.SUPPORT_RTSP.getPropertyCode(), 1);
```

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---| 
|property| The numeric property code identifying the property to set.|
|value| The new value for the property.|
 
**Returns**

Zero if the property was set successfully; non-zero if there was an error.
  
#### native int setRenderOption(int iFlag)

This function configures the paint flags used with the Android bitmap rendering module.

There are multiple rendering modules that can be used for displaying video and NexPlayer automatically selects the best one for the given content and device.

**See Also**
 
NexPlayer.init for more details on possible rendering modules.
 
In the case where the rendering module uses bitmaps provided through the Android API, the rendering options
specified here are used to set up the flags on theandroid.os.Paintobject that is used to display the bitmap.

For all other rendering modules, the values set here are ignored.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---|  
|iFlag| This is an integer representing options for video rendering. This can be zero or more of the following values, combined together using a bitwiseOR. Each value corresponds to an Android API flag available on a Paint object.|

    os.Paint.DITHER\_FLAG.
- **RENDER\_MODE\_VIDEO\_ALLFLAG (0xFFFFFFFF)** Enables all options.

**Returns**

Always zero, but may change in future versions; the return value should be ignored.
 
#### native int setUserCookie(String strCookie)

This method sets a user cookie to be used while playing content.

In prior versions of the NexPlayer SDK, it was only possible to set a user cookie before content was opened in the player but this method makes it possible to set a cookie while content is playing. The cookie set with this method may also be different than an initial cookie set.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---|  
|strCookie| The user cookie to set, as a string. When setting a cookie string, it should start with "Set-Cookie:". For example:<br>`mNexPlayer.setUserCookie("Set-Cookie: [cookie string]");`<br>When setting two or more cookies, it should start with "Cookie:" and each cookies are separated by ";". For example:<br> `mNexPlayer.setUserCookie("Cookie: [cookie string1];[cookie string2];[cookie string3]...");`|
 
**Returns**
 
Zero if successful, non-zero if there was an error.
  
#### int setVideoBitrates(int[] bitrates)

This method allows specific subtracks to be selected and played based on the bitrates of the tracks in HLS content.

Only the tracks with the bitrates passed to this method with the parameterbitrateswill be played by NexPlayer.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---|  
|bitrates| The bitrates of the HLS content subtracks to play, as an integer array.|
 
**Returns**

Zero if successful or a non-zero error code.
 
#### int setVideoBitrates (int[] bitrates, int option)

This method allows specific subtracks to be selected and played based on the bitrates of the tracks in HLS content.

Only the tracks with the bitrates passed on this method with the parameterbitrateswill be played by Nex-
Player. However, choosing a different option with the parameteroptionallows NexPlayer to choose and play
the selected subtracks based on the passed bitrates differently.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---|  
|bitrates| The bitrates of the HLS content subtracks to play, as an integer array.|
|option| How HLS subtracks should be played based on the bitrates selected inbitrates. This will be one of:|
 
- `AVAILBITRATES_NONE` = 0x00000000: Default. No restriction on subtracks other than the bitrates selected inbitrates.
- `AVAILBITRATES_MATCH` = 0x00000001: Only use subtracks which have exact same bitrate as the selected bitrates passed inbitrates.
- `AVAILBITRATES_NEAREST` = 0x00000002: Only use subtracks which have the nearest bitrates to the target bitrates described in the list passed inbitrates. For example, if the target bitrates passed are [300K, 600K] and the HLS playlist includes 100K,200K, 500K, 700K tracks, only the 200K (close to 300K) and 500K (close to 600K) tracks will be used.
- `AVAILBITRATES_HIGH` = 0x00000003: Only use subtracks which have bitrates equal to or higher than the target bitrate. The first bitrate in the list passed in bitrates is  the target bitrate, the rest will be ignored.
- `AVAILBITRATES_LOW` = 0x00000004: Only use subtracks which have bitrates equal to or lower than the target bitrate. The first bitrate in the list passed in bitrates is the target bitrate, the rest will be ignored.
- `AVAILBITRATES_INSIDERANGE` = 0x00000005: Only use subtracks which have bitrates inside the range defined by the bitrates passed inbitrates. The first bitrate in the list is taken as the lower boundary, the second as the upper boundary, and the rest of the list will be ignored. Subtracks with bitrates between the lower and upperboundaries will be used.

**Returns**

Zero if successful or a non-zero error code.
  
#### void setVideoRendererListener (IVideoRendererListener listener)

Registers a callback that will be invoked when new video renderer events occur.

> **Note** All applications **must** implement this callback and provide certain minimal functionality. See the IVideoRendererListener documentation for a list of events and information on implementing them.
 
In an Android application, there are two common idioms for implementing this. The most typical is to have the Activity subclass implement the IVideoRendererListener interface.

The other approach is to define an anonymous class in-line:

```java
mNexPlayer.setVideoRendererListener(new NexPlayer.IVideoRendererListener() {
	@Override
	public void onVideoRenderRender(NexPlayer mp) {
	// ...event implementaton goes here...
	}
	// ...other methods defined by the interface go here...
});
```

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---| 
|listener| The object on which methods will be called when new events occur. This must implement the IVideoRendererListener interface.|
 
**See Also**

- renderers The introductory section on renderers in the NexPlayer SDK.
- NexVideoRenderer
- NexPlayer.IVideoRendererListener
 
#### native int setVolume (float fGain)

This sets the player output volume.

This affects the output of the player before it is mixed with other sounds. Normally, this should be left at the default setting of 1.0, and the volume should be adjusted via the device master volume setting (adjustable by the user via the hardware volume buttons on the device). However, if the application contains multiple audio sources (or if there is other audio being played on the device), this property can be used to reduce the NexPlayer volume in relation to other sounds.

The valid range for this property is 0.0âˆ¼1.0. A value of 0.0 will silence the output of the player, and a value of 1.0 (the default) plays the audio at the original level, affected only by the device master volume setting (controlled by the hardware buttons).

It is not recommended to use this setting for volume controlled by the user; that is best handled by adjusting the device master volume.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---|  
|fGain| This is afloatbetween 0.0 and 1.0. It is set to 1.0 by default.|
 
#### int start ( int msec)

Starts playing media from the specified timestamp.

The media must have already been successfully opened with open. This only works for media that is in the stopped state; to change the play position of media that is currently playing or paused, call seek instead.

When this operation completes, onAsyncCmdComplete is called with one of the following command constants
(depending on the type specified in the open call):

- NEXPLAYER\_ASYNC\_CMD\_START\_LOCAL
- NEXPLAYER\_ASYNC\_CMD\_START\_STREAMING
- NEXPLAYER\_ASYNC\_CMD\_START\_STORE\_STREAM

Success or failure of the operation can be determined by checking theresultargument passed toonAsync-
CmdComplete. If the result is 0, the media was successfully opened; if it is any other value, the operation failed.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---|  
|msec| The offset (in milliseconds) from the beginning of the media at which to start playback. This should be zero to start at the beginning. This parameter will be ignored if content is opened with the NEXPLAYER\_SOURCE\_TYPE\_STORE\_STREAM parameter since the content will be stored instead of played. This parameter must be set to a valid value within the seekable range. The value of the seekable range can be obtained using the `getSeekableRangeInfo()` API. If the content is a live stream, it is recommended to use the LIVE\_VIEW\_OPTION property.|
 
**Returns**

The status of the operation. This is zero in the case of success, or a non-zero NexPlayer error code in the
case of failure.
 
> **Note** This only indicates the success or failure ofstartingthe operation. Even if this reports success, the operation may still fail later, asynchronously, in which case the application is notified in `onAsyncCmdComplete`.
 
#### native int start (int msec,boolean pauseAfterReady)

Starts playing media from the specified timestamp.

The media must have already been successfully opened with open. This only works for media that is in the stopped state; to change the play position of media that is currently playing or paused, call seek instead.

When this operation completes, onAsyncCmdComplete is called with one of the following command constants
(depending on the types pecified in theopencall):

- NEXPLAYER\_ASYNC\_CMD\_START\_LOCAL
- NEXPLAYER\_ASYNC\_CMD\_START\_STREAMING
- NEXPLAYER\_ASYNC\_CMD\_START\_STORE\_STREAM

Success or failure of the operation can be determined by checking theresultargument passed toonAsync-
CmdComplete. If the result is 0, the media was successfully opened; if it is any other value, the operation failed.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---|  
|msec| The offset (in milliseconds) from the beginning of the media at which to start playback. This should be zero to start at the beginning. This parameter will be ignored if content is opened with NEXPLAYER\_SOURCE\_TYPE\_STORE\_STREAMsince the content will be stored instead of played. This parameter must be set to a valid value within the seekable range. The value of the seekable range can be obtained using the `getSeekableRangeInfo()` API. If the content is a live stream, it is recommended to use the LIVE\_VIEW\_OPTION property.|
|pauseAfterReady| If this value is true, NexPlayer will pause just after buffering and before play This parameter will be ignored if content is opened with the NEXPLAYER\_SOURCE\_TYPE\_STORE\_STREAM parameter.  
Note that if this value isTRUE, NexPlayerâ€™s state will be changed to NEXPLAYER\_STATE\_PAUSE when initial
buffering is done. This could take some time.|

**Returns**
 
The status of the operation. This is zero in the case of success, or a non-zero NexPlayer error code in the
case of failure.
 
> **Note** This only indicates the success or failure ofstartingthe operation. Even if this reports success, the operation may still fail later, asynchronously, in which case the application is notified inonAsyncCmdComplete.
 
#### int stop ()

This function stops the current playback.

**Returns**

Zero for success, or a non-zero NexPlayer error code in the event of a failure.

#### void videoOnOff(boolean bOn)

This method turns video rendering on or off.

If video rendering is turned off, any existing frame will remain on the display. If you wish to clear it, you may directly draw to the surface and fill it with black pixels after turning off video rendering.

> **Warning** This method only turns video rendering on or off. Video decoding is still performed.
 
**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---| 
|bOn| TRUE to render video, FALSE to turn off video rendering.|

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | 
|---|---| 
|bOn| 1 to turn on video rendering, 0 to turn off video rendering. Other values are reserved and

### NexVideoView.OnBufferingUpdateListener Interface Reference

The application must implement this interface in order to receive buffering events from NexVideoView.

> **Warning** These callbacks may occur in any thread, not necessarily the main application thread. In some cases, it may not be safe to call UI-related functions from within IListener callbacks. The safest way to update the UI is to use android.os.Handler to post an event back to the main application thread.

### NexVideoView.OnCompletionListener Interface Reference

The application must implement this interface in order to receive NexVideoView events when playback is successful up to the end of the content.

When the playback has completed and onCompletion is returned, setVideoPath or setVideoURI should
be called only after when the player has stopped successfully and onStopComplete is returned by calling stopPlayback.

It is suggested to call stopPlayback at onCompletion. However there are two cases with exceptions :

1. When destroying activity after playback has completed. In this case, request Activity.finish at onCompletion, then call release when activity is destroyed.
2. When seek back to the beginning of content when playback has completed. In this case, seek to a desired position by using seekTo at onCompletion, then call resume.
