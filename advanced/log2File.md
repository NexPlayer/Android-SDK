# NexPlayer Log2File

NexPlayer Log2File feature allows you to save logs on the device and making it easier to debug the playback process. 

## How to enable file logging?

NexPlayer logs can be saved into the device by enabling the following property:

```java
mNexPlayer.setProperty(NexPlayer.NexProperty.SET_LOGS_TO_FILE,
NexLogsToFile.NexFileLogPreset.FULL_LOGS.getIntegerCode());
```

## How to set log level?

Logging level can be set using the NexFileLogPreset:

* DEFAULT
* FOR_PROTOCOL
* FOR_ENGINE
* FOR_AUDIO
* FOR_VIDEO
* FOR_DRM
* FOR_CAPTION
* FULL_LOGS

## How to set file limits?

By default, each log file has a limit of 50MB and no more than 20 files are genereated. Files are rotated when the limit is reached. You can adjust these limit in NexPlayer.java:

```java
public int setProperty(NexProperty property, int value) {
	....

    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.LOLLIPOP) {
        if (null == mLogsToFile) {
            mLogsToFile = new NexLogsToFile.Builder(this)
                    .setPreset(NexLogsToFile.NexFileLogPreset.fromIntegerValue(value))
                    .seFileCount(20)
                    .seBufferSize(50_000)
                    .build();
        }
        mLogsToFile.run();
        return 0;
    } else {
        return -1;
    }
    
    ...
    
}
```

## Where are the log files?

Log files are saved under `/mnt/sdcard/NexPlayerSample/Logs/`

In the below output logs files are from the latest to the oldest : _log.txt â†’ _log.txt.09

### Things to consider
